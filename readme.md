Overview:

The loan management web application will allow users to request loans and others to vote and approve or reject the loan requests. The application will store user data in Flask sessions and enforce a maximum loan amount for each user. The loan amount and pending loan requests will be stored in an in-memory data store.

Architecture and Design Choices:

The application will use the Flask micro-framework to handle web requests and Flask sessions to store user data. The front-end will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap can be used to make the application look nice.

The back-end will use a simple in-memory data store to keep track of loan amounts and pending loan requests. The data store can be implemented using a dictionary in Python.

The loan approval system will use a simple majority voting system where two out of three votes are needed to approve or reject a loan request. The loan requests will be stored in a list in the data store, and each loan request will have a list of votes associated with it

Challenges Faced During Implementation:

One challenge that may arise during implementation is ensuring the security of the application. Flask sessions can be vulnerable to attacks such as session hijacking and cross-site scripting (XSS). To mitigate these risks, the application should use secure cookies and implement proper input validation and sanitization.

Another challenge is handling concurrency in the in-memory data store. If multiple users request loans or vote on loan requests simultaneously, race conditions may occur. To prevent this, the application can use locks or implement a more robust data store such as a database.
